<div id="spoiler1" style="display:none"><p>A sentinel network, Obépine, has been designed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewaters arriving at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in France as an indirect macro-epidemiological parameter. The sources of uncertainty in such a monitoring system are numerous, and the concentration measurements it provides are left-censored and contain outliers, which biases the results of usual smoothing methods. Hence, the need for an adapted pre-processing in order to evaluate the real daily amount of viruses arriving at each WWTP. We propose a method based on an auto-regressive model adapted to censored data with outliers. Inference and prediction are produced via a discretized smoother which makes it a very flexible tool. This method is both validated on simulations and real data from Obépine. The resulting smoothed signal shows a good correlation with other epidemiological indicators and is currently used by Obépine to provide an estimate of virus circulation over the watersheds corresponding to about 200 WWTPs.</p></div>

<div id="spoiler2" style="display:none"><p>Identifying new genetic associations in non-Mendelian complex diseases is an increasingly difficult challenge. These diseases sometimes appear to have a significant component of heritability requiring explanation, and this missing heritability may be due to the existence of subtypes involving different genetic factors. Taking genetic information into account in clinical trials might potentially have a role in guiding the process of subtyping a complex disease. Most methods dealing with multiple sources of information rely on data transformation, and in disease subtyping, the two main strategies used are 1) the clustering of clinical data followed by posterior genetic analysis and 2) the concomitant clustering of clinical and genetic variables. Both of these strategies have limitations that we propose to address. This work proposes an original method for disease subtyping on the basis of both longitudinal clinical variables and high-dimensional genetic markers via a sparse mixture-of-regressions model. The added value of our approach lies in its interpretability in relation to two aspects. First, our model links both clinical and genetic data with regard to their initial nature (i.e., without transformation) and does not require post-processing where the original information is accessed a second time to interpret the subtypes. Second, it can address large-scale problems because of a variable selection step that is used to discard genetic variables that may not be relevant for subtyping. The proposed method was validated on simulations. A dataset from a cohort of Parkinson’s disease patients was also analyzed. Several subtypes of the disease and genetic variants that potentially have a role in this typology were identified.</p></div>
